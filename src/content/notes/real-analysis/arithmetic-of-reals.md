:::stmt[Proposition 9.1]
The set of real numbers $\R$ satisfies the addition axioms, the multiplication axioms, and the distributive axiom. Additionally, if $x$ is a nonzero real number, then $x^{-1} \cdot x = [(1, 1, 1, \dots)]$ (which we now think of as 1).
:::

:::stmt[Definition 9.2]
A nonzero real number $x =[(a_n)]$ is positive if there is at least one Cauchy sequence $(b_n) \in [(a_n)]$ such that

- $(b_n)$ is bounded away from zero, and
- $b_n$ is positive for each $n \in \N$.

Similarly, $x$ is negative if there is at least one Cauchy sequence $(c_n) \in [(a_n)]$ such that

- $(c_n)$ is bounded away from zero, and
- $c_n$ is negative for each $n \in \N$.

:::stmt[Lemma 9.3]
Every real number is exactly one of positive, negative, or zero.
