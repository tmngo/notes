:::stmt[Definition 6.1]
A Cauchy sequence of rational numbers is a sequence $()$ of rational numbers such that for every rational $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a positive integer $N_\epsilon$ such that
$$ |a_m-a_n| < \epsilon \quad \text{whenever}\ m,n \geq N $$
:::

:::stmt[Proposition 6.2]
The sequence $(\frac1n)_{n\in N} = (\frac11, \frac12, \frac13, \frac14, \frac15, \dots)$ is a Cauchy sequence.
:::

:::stmt[Definition 6.5]
A sequence $(a_n)$ (of rational numbers) is bounded if there exists a rational number $M \geq 0$ such that $|a_n| \leq M$ for all $n \geq 1$.
