:::stmt[Definition 20.2]
We say that $f$ is differentiable at $a$ if the limit

$$ \lim\_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} = \lim\_{h\to 0} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} $$

exists and is finite. We call this limit the derivative of $f$ at $a$, which we write as $f'(a).$

:::stmt[Proposition 20.4]
If $f$ is differentiable at $a$, then $f$ is continuous at $a.$

:::stmt[Proposition 20.5]
Let $f$ and $g$ be functions which are differentiable at $a$, and let $c\in \R$. Then $f+g$ and $cf$ are differentiable at $a$. We have the formulae $(f+g)'(a) = f'(a)+g'(a)$ and $(cf)'(a) = c\cdot f'(a).$
