:::stmt[Theorem 22.1]
(Rolle's theorem). Let $f$ be a function which is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$. If $f(a)=f(b)$, then there is a point $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.

:::stmt[Theorem 22.2]
(Cauchy's mean value theorem). Let $f$ and $g$ be functions which are continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$. There is a point $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.

:::stmt[Corollary 22.3]
("The" mean value theorem). Let $f$ and $g$ be functions which are continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$. There is a point $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.
