:::stmt[Definition 8.3]
Let $X$ be the set of all Cauchy sequences of rational numbers, and let ${\sim}$ be the equivalence relation given by Definition 7.2. A real number is an equivalence class in $X/{\sim}$. We denote the set of all real numbers by $\R$. Recall the notation that $[(a_n)]$ is the set of Cauchy sequences of rationals which are equivalent to $(a_n)$ under ${\sim}$.
